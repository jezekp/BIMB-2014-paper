% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

Experiments in electrophysiology produce a lot of unstructured metadata collected in electrophysiology databases. The data are usually accessed through a web interface implemented on the top of data model respecting given data format. A lot of the crucial experimental information is acquired manually  conducted outside the laboratory where access to these databases is not always available. The usage of mobile devices such as tablets or smart phones seems to be a practical solution, but users would welcome the same structured user interface such as they know from a common computer. When user interfaces of electrophysiology databases are tailored to a unique data structure, they cannot be easily reused on a mobile device. As a solution, a mapping of a general data structure to a graphical template is proposed. This mapping is implemented in a framework that generates a template representing the database structure. The parsing process is driven by supplemented annotations added to the code. Next, an Android tool visualizing a graphical layout generated from the template is developed. A use case study is presented on a database of EEG/ERP experiments.

\section{Introduction}\label{Introduction}

With the increasing complexity of electrophysiology experiments, large data sets can be generated within hours.These data sets are only meaningful if the experimental process is clearly documented. For instance, these metadata, in context of our EEG/ERP experiments, usually describes experimental constraints, experimental devices, experimental scenarios, and information about tested subject. In practice, these major metadata are collected separately from the data and often on a paper format. In order to work efficiently with the large amount of acquired scientific data, it has become critical to transition toward digital records and therefore to develop infrastructure to store the computerized data and the associated metadata. Several initiatives in electrophysiology have been created to store and manage various types of electrophysiology data (see State of the Art). We are presenting here an extension of the EEGBase framework allowing to store data and to acquire and manage the necessary metadata for human electrophysiology experiments \cite{ISI:000306821100004}, early release. 
In this version, the EEGBase database was only accessible via a web based user interfaces that allow acquiring, managing and sharing the experimental metadata from a desktop computer. However, it is not always possible to access the web interface in the course of an experiment. To support this particular use-case, we extended the framework to enable the use of mobile devices to acquire experimental metadata \cite{10.3389/fninf.2014.00020}. Our first version was limited to the metadata model predefined in the database. Any modification of the metadata model would require a complete update of the User Interface for the mobile client. 
As creating new user-interface is time-consuming and requires extensive development resources, the challenge is to elaborate a solution to optimize the further development of this platform. We are proposing here a unique system that allows the automatic creation of specific graphical layouts for various platforms (mobile devices, web app, ...). To address this challenge, we transformed the EEGBase framework to use object annotations \cite{6645264} to create internal templates out of the database and convert it into odML, a XML schema designed and used to store experimental metadata \cite{10.3389/fninf.2011.00016}. This odML structure is then transmitted to the mobile device which can generate automatically a graphical layout for rendering the metadata document. As a first pilot system we have implemented an Android based system that generates a template for mobile devices such as tablets or cell-phones. The client-server interactions is based on a RESTful API developed specifically for this project. 
It is important to mention that the use of odML creates a first layer of interoperability with the G-Node database (see Discussion for further information).

The structure of the paper is following. First, we briefly introduce existing databases and mobile-based approaches for electrophysiology data. Then, we describe a proposed mapping that maps the data model of a database to a template expressed in a transport format. Next, we introduce an implementation of proposed mapping in the framework. The rest of the paper describes validation of the presented approach as a part of a use-case study in which integration of the framework in EEGBase  is demonstrated.

\section{State of the Art}

Research in the electrophysiology domain faces a lack of tools and infrastructure for collecting and processing experimental data. There are several organizations implementing an providing tools for data processing, electrophysiological databases or hardware devices. Lots of them are the members of international neuroinformatics community that activities are led by International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility (INCF)\footnote{http://www.incf.org/}.

CRCNS \cite{CRCNS} provides marketplace and discussion forum for sharing tools and data in neuroscience. Helmholtz \cite{10.3389/conf.fninf.2013.09.00025} is a framework for creating neuroscience databases that are customized to the needs of individual neurophysiology labs. Carmen \cite{fgibson:Watson2007} is a virtual laboratory that enables a storage of experimental data, experimental protocols, or analysis code. It designs workflows from the stored code and run them remotely. INCF Dataspace \cite{dataspace} enables interested research groups to connect to a distributed data file system based on iRods\footnote{http://irods.org/}. 
G-Node\footnote{http://www.g-node.org/} provides tools for data access, data management and data sharing, including a data sharing platform \cite{Sobolev:2014} based on common data models for electrophysiological data and metadata \cite{Garcia:2014,10.3389/fninf.2011.00016}.
An odML mobile editor \cite{10.3389/conf.fninf.2014.18.00053} is a standalone app for Android an iOS platform that enables users acquire metadata in a structured format. These metadata can be processed or shared. In addition, reusable templates can be designed and stored inside the device and filled in later.
EEGBase \cite{ISI:000306821100004} is a database of well-described EEG/ERP experimental data sets that enables users to upload, download and manage EEG/ERP experiments. 
A mobile EEGBase client \cite{10.3389/conf.fninf.2013.09.00046} enables users to collect data from EEG/ERP experiments and provides an online synchronization with EEGBase.
While the odML editor is an approach working independently of database structure and the mobile EEGBase client is intended for a client-server system a combination of these two systems is beneficial for current work.

\section{Proposed Framework}\label{Framework}

\subsection{System Restrictions and Requirements}

Facing difficulties mentioned in Section \ref{Introduction} we decided to design and implement a tool that facilitates collection of metadata from experiments by a unified interface customizable to the data structure. In order to ensure an immediate usage, the user interface must be easily generated. In addition, the synchronization of collected data with the electrophysiology database is crucial in the perspective of their sharing and management.

Respecting the requirements from previous paragraph we defined several restrictions that the system must fulfill. It must be inherently client-server oriented. The server end must provide a well-known API to be integrated with most common electrophysiology databases. Moreover, the server and the client must communicate using a unified data format to be easily migrated across different platforms and to be understandable by various clients.

The client end parses the exported data structure and generates a graphical layout. Once the layout is generated, the user can customize it. When the user has the layout prepared, the client is able to download data from the server or push data stored locally. When the client works offline, the data must be stored in an embedded database and synchronized immediately when the client gets back online.



The idea initially presented in \cite{6645264} described a client-server system. The server is able to annotate the database layer of an electrophysiology database. Such annotated layer is then serialized to a XML structure and sent to the client. This idea is extended, implemented and validated in this paper.

\subsection{Mapping Annotated Code to Data Template}\label{Mapping_Code_To_Template}

Modern systems are coded using high-level virtual machine programming languages such as Java, .NET or Python. These languages rely on reflection an ability of a computer program to examine and modify the structure at runtime. Moreover, the code in these languages can be annotated by supplemented metadata. These metadata can be processed by reflection at runtime. Java uses Java Reflection API \cite{1932394184} to read Java Annotations \cite{AnnotationsJavaDevGuide}. These annotations give additional semantic meaning to common Java classes. When a database layer in Java programs is represented by POJOs\footnote{Plain Old Java Object - A Java class with class attributes accessed by get/set methods}, a suitable approach is their extension by specially designed annotations. These annotations provide the means to describe a data template.

As a solution we designed a set of annotations described in Table \ref{annotations}. The annotation \texttt{@Form} represents one form on the layout. If one form is represented by more than one entity, the annotation \texttt{@Multiform} with the same name is used for each entity included in the form. The \texttt{@FormItem} annotation denotes attributes that appear in a specific form. The \texttt{@FormItemRestriction} annotation defines restrictions on individual items. These restrictions can be e. g. minimal and maximal numerical values or maximal length of text values.

When the data layer of the database is annotated, it must be mapped to a suitable transport format. Formats solve description of electrophysiology data on different levels of abstraction from low-level binary formats, through highly abstract implementation-independent data formats till formats based on semantic web ontologies. Each approach has its benefits and difficulties needed to be overcome. We require a format that provides a sufficient level of abstraction to be system independent on one hand, but it should be easy-to-use without any specific requirements for user's knowledge on the other hand. The most flexible ones are Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5) \cite{hdf5} or respectively epHDF or NIX \cite{nix} that are specialized HDF5 for electrophysiology. HDF5 and epHDF5 are the containers for raw binary data and metadata represented in the JSON\footnote{http://json.org/} format. NIX \cite{Stoewer:2014}  provides a data model for storing experimental data in HDF5, together with metadata in the odML format. The odML \cite{10.3389/fninf.2011.00016} is an open format to store and transport metadata more then a container for data. This format brings the following advantages: (1) platform-independence, (2) simplicity and human-readability, (3) ability to transfer layouts as well as metadata with the same format. Because of mentioned benefits of odML we selected it for the framework. 


\section{Implementation}


\subsection{Mapping Implementation}


The mapping presented in Section \ref{Mapping_Code_To_Template} shows transferring persistent Java classes to templates. Then, these templates are mapped to odML representation and transferred to the client. OdML is based on \textit{Sections} that can contain \textit{Properties} and \textit{Values}. Moreover, each section can contain subsections (tree-like structures can be created). In our approach forms are represented by sections, items by subsections and restrictions by properties. Definition \ref{def:Java_annotation_extraction_process} formalizes an extraction process from Java Annotations to corresponding odML representation.

\begin{definition}
\label{def:Java_annotation_extraction_process}
(Java annotation extraction process)

\emph{The process is the transformation of a set of Java annotations JA to an odML Section S in the odML document D that satisfies:}

\emph{$\forall$ $JA{}_{\text{i}}\in {(@Form)}$ $\exists$ odML Section $S{}_{\text{i}}$ $\in$ D $\Rightarrow$ $JA{}_{\text{i}}$ $\in$ a class annotation}.

\emph{$\forall$ $JA{}_{\text{j}}\in {(@FormItem)}$ $\exists$ odML Section $S{}_{\text{j}}$ $\subset$ $S{}_{\text{i}}$ $\in$ D $\Rightarrow$ $JA{}_{\text{j}}$ $\in$ a property
annotation}.

\emph{$\forall$ $JA{}_{\text{k}}\in {(@FormRestriction)}$ $\exists$ odML Property $P{}_{\text{k}}$ $\in$ $S{}_{\text{j}}$ $\in$ D $\Rightarrow$ $JA{}_{\text{k}}$ $\in$ a property  annotation}.

\end{definition}

Listing \ref{class_ex} shows an Example of the class \textit{Person} containing several attributes \textit{givenname}, \textit{surname} and \textit{gender} supplemented by metadata annotations (other annotations, class imports, get/set methods, and other fields are omitted for simplicity).

An XML serialization of this class to an odML document is presented in Listing \ref{odml_rep}. The document shows one section named \textit{Person} with a subsection \textit{gender} (note: Because of the XML serialization is quite long, similar subsections representing other attributes are omitted). All restrictions are represented by properties of this section. In addition, because the Java code is reflective, data types or names of attributes can be straightforwardly transferred to odML properties. With respect to commonly used data types String, Integer, DateTime, Float, Char or Boolean are supported. In addition, a combobox data type is used for arrays or lists of values.

\subsection{Templates Generator}

The template generator is a server part of the presented tool. Figure \ref{framework} shows a block diagram of the template generator. It contains two parsers. The parsing process contains two steps. The first parser "Annotations parser" reads data entities, parses their names, attributes, data types and annotations and stores them in an internal model. The template stored in this model is transferred to an odML document. The Annotation parser is driven by user requests that come through a unified API. When the client generates the layout, the data can be downloaded by the second parser, a "Data parser". The Data parser selects requested data and serializes them into the equally structured odML document. In reverse operation,  when data are uploaded, they are deserialized and transferred to related Java classes by an object builder implemented inside the Data parser.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Mobile Client}

The mobile client is a framework implemented for the Android platform. A client block diagram is shown in Figure \ref{client}. A client input point is an odML deserializer that parses an input odML document into an internal model. The internal model can contain both data and templates. When the client requests a template, this template is transferred to a layout using a layout generator. When the client is requesting data for a specific layout, these data are processed by a data parser. Both layouts and data are stored in an embedded database (SQLLite). It enables users to work offline.

\section{Use Case}

\subsection{Domain Specialization}

The main focus of the research group are methods and techniques of electroencephalography (EEG) and event-related-potentials (ERP). Experiments are conducted in a specialized laboratory equipped with highly specialized hardware and software. Except of this laboratory, we are equipped by a mobile laboratory that enables us to perform experiments outside. In addition we are cooperating in several INCF nodes including German, Belgian, USA or Japan nodes. Our equipment and a lot of discussion with our colleagues motivate us to design a test the solution described.

Experimental procedure follows several steps.  Experiments are performed according to defined scenario. Then data and metadata are collected. These data are analyzed and results are stored and published. The central point of this infrastructure is EEGBase \cite{DBLP:conf/biostec/JezekSBM13} that serves for storing and management of EEG/ERP experiments.

Although the system uses a web-based interface, a lot of experiments are conducted outside the laboratory when the common computer, or Internet access are not available. The aim of this use case is to validate the integration of the presented framework and generation of templates according to data structure. Generation of templates is controlled by an Android phone. When the template is generated, new data can be collected and synchronized with EEGBase.

\subsection{EEGBase} \label{Portal}



EEGBase\footnote{https://eegdatabase.kiv.zcu.cz} provides a simple wizard that guides the user when uploading experiments. The user is instructed what metadata have to be filled in. The collected metadata respecting experience of our research partners with designing and performing experiments and experimental scenarios. The metadata follow ontology described in \cite{BMEI_jezek_moucek}. A user interface preview is shown in Figure \ref{portal}.

The core structure contains the following semantic metadata groups:

\begin{itemize}
\item Scenario of experiment (name, length, description, ...)
\item Experimenters, tested people, experiment owner (given name, surname, contact, experiences, handicaps, ...)
\item Description of raw data (format, sampling frequency, ...)
\item Additional metadata in codebooks (weather, notes, electrode settings, artifact information, ...)
\end{itemize}


\begin{figure}
\centering\includegraphics[width=8cm, height=5cm]{portal_preview}
\caption{\label{portal}EEGBase Preview}

\end{figure}

We prepared a simple proof-of-concept implementation based on a restricted set of metadata to demonstrate functionality of the framework. We selected the most important medata and annotate them by described annotations. Table \ref{entities_and_fields} shows selected entities with their annotated attributes.

\end{table}

Since EEGBase implements RESTFull web services \cite{Richardson:2007:RWS:1406352}, control of the framework API by client requests is ensured. We implemented two methods; one for listing available templates and the second one for downloading a selected template\footnote{All API methods all described more in detail in a project wiki page: https://github.com/INCF/eeg-database/wiki/RESTful-API}.

\subsection{Mobile Client} \label{Mobile_Client}

The mobile client uses common design of Android applications. Main activities of the use-case study are shown in several screen-shots in Figure \ref{fig:mob_app_prev}. Because the client is intended to work with various electrophysiological databases, it enables creating separate workspaces where each workspace works with different user credentials. In Figure \ref{fig:mob_app_preva} the user creates a new workspace. Users credentials are optional because the client can work as a stand alone system as well. In Figure \ref{fig:mob_app_prevb} available layouts are listed; the user can download them. Finally, in Figure \ref{fig:mob_app_prevc} the user can download data from the server or add new data as shown in Figure \ref{fig:mob_app_prevd}.

By following the described steps we created one workspace connected to EEGBase (see Figure\ref{fig:mob_app_preva}) and downloaded available layouts (Person, Scenario, Experiment and DataFile as listed in Figure \ref{fig:mob_app_prevb}). When the layouts were downloaded experiments from the server were listed (see Figure \ref{fig:mob_app_prevc}). Finally, we add several new experiments using form listed in Figure \ref{fig:mob_app_prevd}. These experiments were stored on the server.

\section{Future Work}

The proposed solution works satisfactorily and the presented use-case study validates its functionality on real data. However, the presented pilot implementation has several gaps that are planned to be overcome. 

First, we will focus our effort on developing the mobile client to offer the possibility to create templates natively on the client, allowing to work offline. For this purpose, we will merge efforts between the EEGBase client and the mobile odML editor \cite{10.3389/conf.fninf.2014.18.00053} to propose a unique mobile client that would work on both database. With this work, we will extend the interoperability between these two resources.
Secondly, we will address the problem of data and metadata storage. As electrophysiological data are heterogeneous, the usage of NoSQL databases seems to be more practical. Our first tests prove \cite{Jezek2014422} that a shift from a relational database to a NoSQL one brings a lot of benefits handling metadata. The very first next step is to propose a suitable mapping of heterogeneous metadata stored in a NoSQL database to a suitable data template. The next improvement includes an extension of the mobile client to other platforms (iPhone, Windows Phone)\footnote{several frameworks as http://phonegap.com/ enables development of platform independent mobile applications} and extension of the server part of the framework not to work only with Java-based servers.



\section{Conclusion}

Update portal capabilities with improving mobile client
Interoperability with other resources. Using a common format.

Experiments in electrophysiology domain produce a lot of collections of semi-structured data and metadata. To organize these metadata, various data formats implemented in electrophysiological databases have been introduced. Data in these databases are accessed from laboratory computers using fixed user interfaces. Therefore these databases are unreachable where a common computer is not available. With expansion of mobile devices users would like to manage data using their smart phones. Because the dual development of user interfaces for both common computers and mobile devices increases demands to developers and reduces users experience with these systems, we proposed an annotation framework that enables to generate graphical layouts for mobile devices automatically. This framework enables users to map a data layer of an electrophysiological database and create the template representing the data structure. This template is serialized to an odML document and transferred to the client system. The client system parses this template and generates a graphical layout displayed in the device. In addition, when the layout is prepared, the experimental data can be synchronized with the server.
